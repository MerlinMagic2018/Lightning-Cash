LightningCash Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
LightningCash Core is the original LightningCash client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of LightningCash transactions (which is currently more than 7 GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download LightningCash-Gold Core, visit [lightningcash-gold.com](http://lightningcash-gold.com).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run LightningCash on your native platform.

### Unix

- `bin/lightningcash_gold-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/lightningcash_goldd` (headless)

### Windows
